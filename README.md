Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning

This repository contains an R Markdown file that demonstrates how to perform predictions using supervised machine learning techniques. The analysis includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation metrics.
File Description

    Prediction Using Supervised ML.Rmd: This R Markdown file contains the code and explanations for performing supervised machine learning predictions.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

To run the code in the R Markdown file, you need to have R and RStudio installed. Additionally, you need to install the following R packages:

    caTools
    dplyr
    Metrics

You can install these packages using the following commands:

r

install.packages("caTools")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("Metrics")

Running the R Markdown File

    Open Prediction Using Supervised ML.Rmd in RStudio.
    Make sure all the necessary packages are installed (see Prerequisites).
    Click the "Knit" button in RStudio to render the R Markdown file. This will generate an HTML output displaying the analysis and results.

Contents of the R Markdown File

The R Markdown file includes the following sections:

    Introduction: An overview of the purpose of the analysis.
    Data Preprocessing: Steps for cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
    Data Splitting: Code for splitting the data into training and testing sets.
    Model Training: Instructions and code for training the supervised machine learning model.
    Model Evaluation: Calculation and interpretation of evaluation metrics such as RMSE and MAE.
    Conclusion: Summary of findings and conclusions from the analysis.

Example Usage

Here is a brief example of how to use the provided R Markdown file for a supervised machine learning task:

    Load the Data: Load your dataset into R.

    r

data <- read.csv("path/to/your/data.csv")

Split the Data: Split the data into training and testing sets.

r

library(caTools)
set.seed(123)
split <- sample.split(data$target_variable, SplitRatio = 0.8)
trainingset <- subset(data, split == TRUE)
testset <- subset(data, split == FALSE)

Train the Model: Train your supervised machine learning model.

r

model <- lm(target_variable ~ ., data = trainingset)

Evaluate the Model: Evaluate the model's performance using RMSE and MAE.

r

    predictions <- predict(model, newdata = testset)
    actuals <- testset$target_variable

    rmse <- sqrt(mean((actuals - predictions)^2))
    mae <- mean(abs(actuals - predictions))

    print(paste("RMSE:", rmse))
    print(paste("MAE:", mae))
